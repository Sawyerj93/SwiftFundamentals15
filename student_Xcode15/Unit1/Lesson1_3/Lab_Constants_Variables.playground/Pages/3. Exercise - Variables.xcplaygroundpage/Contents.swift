## Exercise - Variables
 
 Declare a variable `schooling` and set it to the number of years of school that you have completed. Print `schooling` to the console.

var schooling = 8
print(schooling)

//:  Now imagine you just completed an additional year of school, and update the `schooling` variable accordingly. Print `schooling` to the console.
schooling = 9
print(schooling)

//:  Does the above code compile? Why is this different than trying to update a constant? Print your explanation to the console using the `print` function.
print("The above code does compile because schooling is assigned as a variable that can change. by simply doing schooling = 9 it changes the previous variable to the current variable")
